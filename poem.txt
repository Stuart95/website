The Unrealistic
By Marlon


It began Winter as winter day, one of the darkest,
Horrid, and coldest ever experienced.
Dead leaves were running corpses wandering
Where the next stop was going to be.
A being will perform the unthinkable and most dreadful act
There he was sitting down at the back porch with his family
As he was looking close at his blurry reflection on
The front window, unable to tell who he was.
Finding himself trapped between the realistic and unrealistic.
He saw the murderous silver shine
Moving slowly towards his brother's side
In an instant, he made a move to save 
His brother's life
That was his beloved mother, looking extremely young
And innocently sinister.
After a split second
He abruptly stabbed the shining object 
Towards his mother's life.
Unable to process what happened, fear 
And pain was flashing across his eyes
He then looked at the window 
And his reflection was clearly I.
I held my dearly mom tight
Then heard her last breath say,
"Everything is going to be alright".
My inner self woke bursting in tears
And for a moment everything became silent,
Did I just kill my immoral self?
